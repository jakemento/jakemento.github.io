# Ping Pong Number Generator
####website building exercise for Epicodus, 01.22.2015
###By Jacob Steinberg
##Description
This is a website I created for my third code review. Its main function is to, given a number, display all the numbers up to that number, replacing numbers divisible by 3 with ping, divisible by 5 with pong, and divisible by 15 with pingpong. This web site is an exercise in HTML, Javascript and jquery, and is a lesson in using scripts and a spec runner.
##Program Setup Instructions
navigate to the site, enter in a number, then you will see it displayed with the divisibles as either ping, pong, or ping pong.
